📈 Forecast Model
Welcome to the Forecast-Model project!
This repo is home to a robust time series forecasting tool, built primarily using Python's heavy-hitters: Prophet, SARIMA, and a sprinkle of custom optimization magic. It’s designed to predict sales trends, inventory needs, and purchase order (PO) requirements — all while keeping future operations running smoother than a freshly waxed surfboard. 🏄

🚀 Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to forecast future sales and inventory levels for a set of products (ASINs). This helps businesses:

Plan purchase orders (POs) more efficiently

Optimize inventory to avoid stockouts or overstock

Make data-driven business decisions with confidence

This system is particularly geared towards Amazon sales data but can be easily adapted for broader e-commerce or retail datasets.

🛠️ Key Features
Multi-model forecasting: Uses Prophet and SARIMA models depending on data availability and performance.

PO Coverage Analysis: Evaluates how upcoming POs impact future inventory.

Restock Suggestions: Auto-generates restock recommendations based on forecasted sales and current inventory levels.

Flexible Input: Works with Excel/CSV files for seamless integration into existing workflows.

Optimization Caching: Saves model parameters for faster re-training and better forecasting accuracy.

📊 How to Use It
Prepare your data:

weekly_sales_data.xlsx

inventory_data.xlsx

po database.xlsx

Run Forecast Model Prophet Main.py

Review outputs in forecasts_folder/, po_coverage_analysis/, and others.

Make smart inventory decisions — and maybe even impress your boss. 😎

📦 Dependencies
You’ll want to have these ready:

Python 3.8+

pandas

fbprophet / prophet

statsmodels

openpyxl

scikit-learn

matplotlib

P.S. A requirements.txt file would be a cherry on top if you feel like adding it.

📚 Future Improvements
Add ensemble forecasting (blending Prophet and SARIMA predictions)

Build a simple UI (maybe Streamlit?) for easier non-technical access

Automate PO adjustment suggestions via scheduled jobs

✨ Acknowledgements
Huge thanks to the open-source community behind Prophet and statsmodels, who made building powerful forecasting tools feel way less like black magic and more like actual data science.
